AREDN Services Overview
=======================

.. attention:: This section of the documentation is a work in progress.

As mentioned in the AREDN |trade| overview, the purpose of an amateur radio emergency data network is to provide typical Internet or intranet-type applications to people who need to communicate across a wide area during an emergency or community event. An AREDN |trade| network provides the transport mechanism for the types of applications people rely upon to communicate with each other in the normal course of their business and social interactions today. This may include keyboard-to-keyboard chat, email messages with text or image attachments, file transfer, collaborative document sharing, :abbr:`VoIP (Voice over IP)` phone service, video conferencing, GPS tracking, surveillance camera streaming, weather station reporting, sensor monitoring and control, repeater linking, and many other services.

The purpose for this section of the AREDN |trade| documentation is to identify the types programs that might be useful for communication across a mesh network. Almost any application that can operate across a peer-to-peer TCP/IP network is a candidate for AREDN |trade| networking, but you should carefully select and test your services to ensure they will work within the following restrictions.

* An important consideration for selecting programs is to understand the impact each service will have on the performance and reliability of the network during the times when digital communication is required.

* It is equally important to choose data services that will meet the criteria defined in FCC Part 97 regulations for amateur radio operators.
