=============================
Responsible Disclosure Policy
=============================

The members of the AREDN |trade| team believe in the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities that may be discovered in the software. To further the goal of responsible disclosure, we request those persons who believe they may have discovered a security vulnerability to contact the *Security Team* via email at: **securityteam@arednmesh.org** The *Security Team* will work with you to ensure that the vulnerabilities are patched prior to public disclosure.

Furthermore we understand that other organizations may be developing firmware based on the solutions we have published. To that end the AREDN |trade| group has created a security program for such organizations to be informed of discovered vulnerabilities so they can secure their offerings prior to the public disclosure of such vulnerabilities. To apply to our security program please contact **securityteam@arednmesh.org**
