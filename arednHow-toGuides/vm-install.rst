Virtual Machine Installs
========================

The use of virtual machines as AREDN® nodes is for advanced users. Most users should use *Mikrotik ac2* or *ac3* hardware to achieve similar functionality. These instructions are provided with the assumption that you understand your virtualization platform and are familiar with creating images and uploading virtual disks. The x86_64 image has been tested and is considered stable on the Proxmox, Unraid, QEMU, and VMware ESXi platforms, so usage on other virtualization platforms may not work as expected.

Prerequisites / Image information
---------------------------------

At a minimum the VM must have two virtual CPUs, 64mb memory, and 128mb of storage. Providing more CPU is generally not needed on modern hardware.

There are two modes for networking: single-port and multi-port. Set the number of interfaces *before* powering on the VM for the first time. Regardless of the number of interfaced created, the node will initially be configured in 'single-port mode'. This can be changed later in the AREDN UI.

Single-port mode
  All traffic utilizes VLANs as described in the *Advanced Options* section of the *Network Settings* dialog in the **Node Admin** documentation. This requires your virtual interface to be VLAN aware or to be set as a passthrough interface.

Multi-port mode
  Ports can be assigned as needed to be LAN, DtD or WAN links. If your virtual interface is VLAN aware, you can tag VLANs; otherwise the interface should be untagged, which is the recommended setting. As an example, if you have three interfaces defined, you might assign ports as follows:

  - First interface: WAN
  - Second interface: DtD
  - Third interface: LAN

.. note:: The images do not include any *vmtools* but they do contain drivers for the standard QEMU/VMware paravirtualized storage and networking. Using the paravirtualized devices is recommended.

Proxmox Installs
----------------

*Proxmox Virtual Environment* is an open-source server management platform for virtualization. There is an updated checklist of steps for Proxmox installs on the `Bay Area Mesh Wiki <https://wiki.bayareamesh.us/index.php/AREDN_on_Proxmox>`_.

QEMU Installs
-------------

1. Download the latest firmware image from the AREDN® downloads website.

2. Extract the .gz file. *7zip* on Windows may have issues with the .gz file, so you may need to download *gzip* for Windows or extract it on a Linux or Mac computer/VM.

3. Upload/copy the ``.img`` file to your VM server. You can rename the image if you desire.

4. Create the VM/Domain on your server and assign the ``.img`` file to it.

5. Boot the VM and proceed with the AREDN® node configuration steps.

VMware Installs
---------------

For VMware you will need to use QEMU tools or another V2V converter in order to convert the image to ``vmdk`` format. Some example software is listed below:

- `QEMU for Windows binaries (Unoffical) <https://qemu.weilnetz.de/w64/>`_
- `QEMU Official downloads <https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows>`_
- `Starwind Converter <https://www.starwindsoftware.com/starwind-v2v-converter>`_

1. Download the latest firmware image from the AREDN® downloads website.

2. Extract the .gz file. *7zip* on Windows may have issues with the .gz file, so you may need to download *gzip* for Windows or extract it on a Linux or Mac computer/VM.

3. Convert the ``.img`` to ``.vmdk`` using your V2V converter of choice. For example, if you are using QEMU, open a terminal/command prompt and on Windows navigate to where QEMU is installed (normally ``c:\Program Files\qemu\``). Run the following command, replacing "aredn.vmdk" and "aredn.img" with the filenames you have chosen.

::

  qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk aredn.img aredn.vmdk

If you are using Virtualbox, below is the built-in command, replacing "aredn.vmdk" and "aredn.img" with the filenames you have chosen.

::

  VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename aredn.vmdk -rawdisk aredn.img

4. Create the VM/Domain on your server, but *do not assign it a disk*.

5. Upload/copy the ``.vmdk`` file to your server. You can rename the image if you desire.

6. ``ssh`` to the ESXi host, navigate to where the ``.vmdk`` file was uploaded and run the following command to verify/fix any conversion issues. This step helps to identify and fix potential image errors.

::

  vmkfstools -i uploaded.vmdk verified.vmdk

7. Assign the verified ``.vmdk`` disk to the VM.

8. Boot the VM and proceed with the AREDN® node configuration steps.
