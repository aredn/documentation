# Internationalization and AREDN

## Overview

In an effort to make the AREDN network more globally accessible to non-English speaking communities, the AREDN documentation has integrated an `internationalization` framework. At a high level, this is a three-step process.

1. Pull request to add necessary libraries and changes to `conf.py` to facilitate a multi-language environment of the documentation.
2. Using Weblate or Transifex, establish an online capability (and associated change management/pull request process that feeds into the Github repository) that allows those proficient in a chosen foreign language to easily contribute their expertise in translating the AREDN documentation. 
3. In an iterative process, seek ways to expand and improve the workflow as more languages are integrated.

## Weblate or Transifex

TODO - setup online translation hub for selected language(s)
