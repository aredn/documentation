# AREDN Documentation
This repository is for creating documentation for the AREDN project so it can be made available on ReadTheDocs.

## Contributing:
If you are interested in contributing to the rapidly growing set of AREDN related information, you can easily do so on GitHub. This works the same way as if you were contributing code to the project.

AREDN documentation is written using the reStructuredText markup language. Text is saved in "rst" files.

After you setup your GitHub account, you should:

1. FORK the AREDN documentation repository to your GitHub account.
2. Then, to send updates or additions, checkout your repository from github.com/your-account/documentation, commit local changes you have made (additions or corrections to the AREDN docs), push to origin (your repository).
3. Create a pull request.

The AREDN team will then review your request just as it does for code changes. Once your documentation contributions are committed to the AREDN GitHub repository, a webhook updates and builds the latest docs for viewing and exporting on ReadTheDocs.org

## Viewing the Docs:
To view the AREDN documentation in a web browser, navigate to ReadTheDocs.org and search for the AREDN Documentation.

## Exporting to PDF:
While viewing the AREDN documentation in your web browser, you will see the Topics list in the left panel. At the bottom of the panel is a drawer labeled "ReadTheDocs" showing the version you are viewing. Click the label bar to open it. From the drawer you can export the documentation set as a single PDF or Epub file. This is handy if you want to take a PDF copy of the guidebook with you into the field where you do not have Internet access.
