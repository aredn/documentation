# AREDN® Documentation
This repository is for creating what could be called the online "User Guide" for the AREDN® project. The documentation posted here will be automatically built and displayed on [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.arednmesh.org/en/latest/).

> **NOTE:** This repository is only for the AREDN® user documentation that will be displayed on *ReadTheDocs*. Additional documentation can be found in the AREDN® code repository as well as on the AREDN® website, but any issues for those items must be entered at their respective sites.

## Viewing the Docs:
To view the AREDN® documentation in a web browser, navigate to [https://docs.arednmesh.org/en/latest/](https://docs.arednmesh.org/en/latest/) or select your choice from the `Docs` dropdown menu on [https://www.arednmesh.org](https://www.arednmesh.org).

## Exporting to PDF:
While viewing the AREDN® documentation in your web browser, you will see the contents list in the left panel. At the bottom of the panel is a drawer labeled "ReadTheDocs" showing the version you are viewing. Click the label bar to open it. From the drawer you can export the documentation set as a single PDF or Epub file. This is handy if you want to take a PDF copy of the guidebook with you into the field where you do not have Internet access.

## Contributing:
If you are interested in contributing to the rapidly growing set of AREDN® related information, you can easily do so on GitHub. The workflow for contributing documentation is described in detail here: [How to Use GitHub for AREDN](https://github.com/aredn/documentation/blob/master/How%20to%20Use%20GitHub%20for%20AREDN.md).

AREDN® documentation is written using the [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html) markup language and your text is saved in "rst" files. **Before committing your changes, be sure to test your *rst* files locally using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html) to ensure that they will render correctly.**

Your local code branch name can be anything that makes sense to you. After you create your Pull Request, the AREDN® team will review your request just as it does for code changes. Once your documentation contributions are committed to the AREDN® GitHub repository, a webhook automatically updates and builds the latest docs for viewing and exporting on ReadTheDocs.org. All contributions that are included by the AREDN® team in the documentation set will be covered by the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license held by Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network, Inc.
