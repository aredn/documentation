Contributing AREDN |trade| Documentation
----------------------------------------

If you are interested in contributing to the rapidly growing set of AREDN |trade| documentation you can easily do so on GitHub. To contribute to the AREDN |trade| project you first must create your own GitHub account. This is free and easy to do by following these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the `GitHub URL <https://github.com>`_.
2. Click the ``Sign Up`` button and enter a username, email, and password. We suggest using your callsign as the username.
3. On the GitHub website, click the ``Sign In`` button and enter your username or email followed by your GitHub password.
4. Navigate on GitHub to the AREDN |trade| documentation repository: https://github.com/aredn/documentation.
5. Click the ``Fork`` button at the upper right corner of the page. After this process completes, you will have your own copy of the AREDN |trade| documentation files on your GitHub account.
6. Go to your local computer and clone your fork of the AREDN |trade| documentation: ``git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ID/documentation``
7. Navigate on your local computer to the folder where your cloned copy of the repository is located: ``cd documentation``  This directory contains your local copy of the AREDN |trade| documentation, and all of your document editing should be done while you are in this directory or its subdirectories.

The workflow for contributing documentation is identical to the workflow for contributing code which is described in the file titled **How to Use GitHub for AREDN**, a copy of which you already have in your new local repository. Refer to that document for additional information about contributing AREDN |trade| documentation.

Your local editing branch name can be anything that makes sense to you as you add topics to the documentation. AREDN |trade| documentation is written using the `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`_ markup language and your text is saved in "rst" files. Before committing your changes, be sure to test your rst files locally using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html>`_ to ensure they will render correctly.

After you create a Pull Request on GitHub, the AREDN |trade| team will review your changes. Once your documentation contributions are committed to the AREDN |trade| GitHub repository, a webhook automatically updates and builds the latest docs for viewing and exporting on ReadTheDocs.org
